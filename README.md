# PWA & Project Fugu Workshop

Progressive Web Apps are a great cross-platform application model, even if somewhat restricted in use—until now, that is. Project Fugu is an initiative led by Google, Microsoft, and Intel. Their goal: a more capable web. Home screen shortcuts, clipboard and file system access are only a few examples of Fugu’s powerful APIs. Are you ready to superpower your Progressive Web App?
